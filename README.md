# Repository C++

This repository is divided into 3 parts:
1. Course
2. Exercises
3. Shortcuts

## Course
The course is divided into the following parts:

1. Basic (Basic syntax and general usage).

1.1. C Course (Basic C course, as it forms the basis of the C++ 
language).

1.2. STL (Standard Template Library, C++ libraries, basic data 
structures library).

2. Intermediate (native C++ topics not yet covered, such as pointers, 
arrays, less generic data types, and some aspects of C, in C++).

3. Advanced (Home-created data structures and algorithms).

## 2. Exercises
All the C++ exercises I have done are mostly competitive programming 
and are organized as follows:

1. OmegaUP 
2. Codeforces 
3. Atcoder
4. Leetcode
5. Preparacion-ONC
6. Others

## 3. Shortcuts
There are the keyboard shortcuts for:

1. VsCode.
2. Vim.
3. Windows.

This is to keep the shortcuts in mind while coding and learn them.

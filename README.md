# Repository C++

This repository is divided into 3 parts:
1. Course
2. Exercises
3. Shortcuts

## Course
The course is divided into the following parts:

1. Basic (Basic syntax and general usage)

1.1. C-Course (Basic C course, as it is the foundation of the C++ 
language)

1.2. STL (Standard Template Library, C++ libraries)

2. Intermediate (these are topics that have not yet been seen, 
from C++ that are native C, such as pointers, arrays, less generic 
data types, and some things from C, in C++)

3. Advance (Data structures and algorithms).

> Note: From 2.Intermediate to 3.Advanced, these are not essential; 
> they are only necessary to optimize and understand the language in 
> more depth, as well as ways of optimizing it and doing things.

## 2. Exercises
All the C++ exercises I have done are mostly competitive programming 
and are organized as follows:


## 3. Shortcuts
There are the keyboard shortcuts for:

1. VsCode.
2. Vim.
3. Windows.

This is to keep the shortcuts in mind while coding and learn them.
